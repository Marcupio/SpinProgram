# SpinProgram

This is the program I wrote for my M.S. Thesis in physics at California State University, Northridge.

The program's main purpose was to generate Hamiltonians--energy level data--for the 2D quasi-Heisenberg Spin Model for various lattice sizes, e.g. 4x4, 4x5, 4x6, and then analyze that data to determine when the system entered what is known as the Many-Body localization (MBL) phase.

The MBL phase has application in quantum memory for quantum computers.
